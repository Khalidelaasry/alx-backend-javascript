## Introduction
Welcome to the **0x00. ES6 Basics** project. This project is part of the ALX software engineering program, and its focus is on introducing the core features of ECMAScript 6 (ES6). ES6 is a major update to JavaScript that brings new syntax and features, improving readability, performance, and scalability.

## Project Overview
This project provides an understanding of ES6 fundamentals. It covers key features like:
- Variable declarations (`let` and `const`)
- Arrow functions
- Default function parameters
- Rest and spread operators
- Template literals
- Object destructuring
- Iterators and the `for...of` loop
- String and array methods

The tasks in this project help reinforce the concepts through hands-on coding exercises. By completing these tasks, you will gain practical experience in writing more concise and efficient JavaScript code using modern ES6 features.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:
1. Understand the difference between `var`, `let`, and `const` in ES6.
2. Write arrow functions and explain their benefits over traditional function expressions.
3. Use template literals to interpolate variables and expressions into strings.
4. Understand and use the `rest` and `spread` operators.
5. Work with enhanced object literals and object destructuring.
6. Leverage new string and array methods introduced in ES6.
7. Implement iteration using `for...of` loops.

## Project Requirements
- **Node.js version 14.x or higher** is required to run the project code.
- Your code should adhere to the JavaScript style guidelines specified in the [Airbnb style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).
- All JavaScript files should be linted using ESLint.

### Mandatory Tasks:
1. **Variable declarations (`let`, `const`)** – Explore how block scoping and immutability work in ES6.
2. **Arrow functions** – Learn how arrow functions simplify syntax and change the behavior of `this`.
3. **Rest and spread operators** – Work with multiple function parameters and array concatenation.
4. **Destructuring** – Extract values from arrays and objects with ease.
5. **Template literals** – Use backticks to create dynamic strings.
6. **Iterators** – Iterate over arrays and other iterable objects.

### Advanced Tasks:
Gain deeper insights into advanced ES6 features by completing the optional tasks.

## Installation
