## Introduction
This project focuses on **Promises** in **ES6** (ECMAScript 6), an important feature for handling asynchronous operations in JavaScript. Promises provide a cleaner, more readable way to manage asynchronous code compared to traditional callbacks. They allow you to write non-blocking code and handle success or failure scenarios more effectively.

## Project Overview
In this project, you will learn the basics of Promises and how to handle asynchronous operations in modern JavaScript. Promises help manage async tasks such as API calls, file handling, and other time-consuming operations without blocking the execution of the program.

### Key topics covered in this project include:
- **Creating and resolving promises**
- **Promise chaining**
- **Error handling with `.catch()`**
- **Using `Promise.all()` and `Promise.race()`**
- **Working with async/await (advanced)**

The tasks in this project will help you gain practical experience in using Promises to handle asynchronous operations in a more predictable way.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:
1. Understand what a Promise is and how it works.
2. Create and resolve promises in JavaScript.
3. Chain multiple promises together for more complex async flows.
4. Properly handle errors in promise chains using `.catch()`.
5. Use `Promise.all()` to run multiple promises in parallel.
6. Understand `Promise.race()` and its use cases.
7. Optionally, work with the newer `async/await` syntax for asynchronous code.

## Project Requirements
- **Node.js version 14.x or higher** is required to run the project.
- Your code should follow the **Airbnb JavaScript style guide**.
- All JavaScript files should be linted using **ESLint**.

### Mandatory Tasks:
1. **Simple Promise** – Learn to create and resolve a simple promise.
2. **Chaining Promises** – Practice chaining multiple promises together to handle complex async workflows.
3. **Error Handling** – Learn how to catch and handle errors in promises using `.catch()`.
4. **Promise.all()** – Combine multiple promises and resolve them simultaneously.
5. **Promise.race()** – Handle multiple promises and return the result of the first one to resolve or reject.

### Advanced Tasks:
- **Async/Await** – An advanced feature introduced in ES8 to make working with promises even cleaner and easier to read.
